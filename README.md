In this web application, we created an eCommerce store named Shoppers. Like any other online business web application, shopeos allows any visitor to shop for their favorite items from the available products on the website. In Shopeos.com, we implemented two modules, one for the user and the other for the admin. 
Users will be able to view the available products divided into separate categories. If they like a product and want to purchase it, they will be able to add it to their cart. Each user will have a separate cart which will consist of the products that they have added. Users can add or remove products in their cart. The product which is out of stock will automatically be removed from the cart, allowing a smooth user experience. Upon checkout, users will be able to enter shipping details and confirm their orders. Users will also be able to view their orders on my orders page along with the status of the order and the tracking number. All the user details will be synced with the SQL Database.

On the other hand, admins will be able to add/remove any product or category. Admins are allocated separate modules which they can access with the /dashboard URL. Hence allowing admins to take full control of the application with security. Admin will also be able to view all the orders and the users of the application. The entries of the admin module will be synced with the SQL database
